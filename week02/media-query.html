            <h2>Moroni 10:5-7</h2>
            <p>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. And whatsoever thing is good is
                just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is.
                And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny
                not the power of God; for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same
                today and tomorrow, and forever.

            <h2>Either 12:6</h2>
            <p>
                And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith
                is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no
                witness until after the trial of your faith.
